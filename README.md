# Girl-In-The-Machine

She is 22 years old.  Even then she still has dreams where she's 8 and walking through the halls of her old house by the lake.  In those dreams everything is more alive than how she remembers them, yet hardly anything is in the right place.  She hears the echo of a woman's voice from across the room and she is scared to go towards it because she knows that once she does, she'll wake up and the house is gone. 

The familiar touch of cold marble presses against the soles of her feet and she decides to keep dreamingâ€¦for a little while.
